Slides and speaker script for the SNOLAB R4 phonon pulse-template talk.

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `SNOLAB_R4_pulse_templates_20260715.pptx` | 13 slides, 16:9, English; each slide has English speaker notes |
| `SNOLAB_R4_pulse_templates_20260715.pdf` | PDF export of the deck |
| `speech_script.md` / `.pdf` | speaker script, per-slide Chinese + English paragraph pairs, with timing hints and Q&A backup answers |
| `figures/` | slide-sized crops of the tall multi-channel diagnostic figures in `lp_fit_align/results/plots/` and of the Ge-activation ops PDF (page 5, Z7) |
| `make_crops.py` | regenerates `figures/` from the versioned diagnostic PNGs |
| `build_pptx.py` | regenerates the .pptx (python-pptx); PDF export was done via PowerPoint |

Slide flow: title → K-line selection & raw cache → per-trace algorithm →
fit grids → aligned overlays → NRMSE cut (+ raw-trace validation) →
τ_rise cut → shadow (genuine slow) population → Z7 PDS2 artifact →
2-exp weighted 1x1 templates → NxM PCA templates → deliverables & open items.

Slide 10 (Z7 PDS2) is the designated skip-slide if running long.
